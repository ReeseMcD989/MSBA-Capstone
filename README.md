# MSBA-Capstone
Documents from my MSBA Capstone Project on moving average strategies.

The poster and paper were created without the consideration of commission fees associated with trading futures contracts.
The Python script has been modified and progressed since the submission of the capstone deliverables and now includes
commission fees and max draw down in the analysis. The script is also now using 5 minute data instead of hourly data.

There is another script that I built for this project, but I've chosen not to include it in this repository yet as I'm
in the middle of reworking it to be able to handle processesing 1 minute data and more period lengths.
